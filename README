# Introduction

The erlang-openflow is a pure erlang implementation of an openflow controller
which is being contructed on top of OTP framework.

# Quick start

    $ make
    $ ./start
    (The controller will start to listen to 6633 port)

TIP: Use mininet (http://openflow.org/mininet) to simulate an openflow network.
